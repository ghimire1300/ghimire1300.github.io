When I was 9, I had an xbox 360 that I played a couple of games on. I probably
cant tell you exactly what those games are since its been more than a decade,
but I can tell you I wasn't the only person with an xbox 360. People at my
school had xbox's too, and some of them had particular games they would play
with each other, over an online server. One of these games was Call of Duty,
 and I can still remember, from Modern Warfare 2, to Halo 4, all the way to 
Black Ops 3, these FPS's. First person shooters, that were so interactive
that you could have played for hours, and you wouldn't have even noticed.

Fast forward to when I was 10. At walmart with my dad, looking for games to buy
, and I come across a game I recognized. Skyrim. My curiosity peaked, and I asked
my father if we could buy it. I made my character, made my way down to the local
cities, stole a horse, and got killed by a guard. And ever since then, Skyrim,
in some way, shape or form, has always been on my mind. 

I think about FPS's, not as video games, but as paradigms, particularly, a 
paradigm of Game mechanics. And RPG's. Aren't they all storytelling?

Can you have an RPG, without telling a story? Can you have an FPS with a
story too, or is it doomed to just be an amusing escapism, devoid of any 
meaning other than to shoot and kill?
