I haven't watched it all, but I have watched enough of George Hot'z videos to get a good idea of who he is, and the things he talks about. One video, I suppose stood out, titled "Jailbreaking the Simulation",
where he talks about not only "breaking out", of the simulation, but also, killing "God", or in other words, rising above what may be simulated to "true" reality.

Or at least I think he talks about that. Might have to watch the actual video...

Anyway, he brings up Skyrim at one point, so you know I'm interested. Mind you, I've been playing recently, first time for a very long time and...

I HATE THE NPCS!!!!!

They are so talkative! You walk past them, not even looking at them, and they talk! Like dude, I'm trying to mind my own business here!

Is it the same in real life? No, of course not, people aren't scripted bots. 

But they aren't NPC's either. They're playable, just not by...

Us. You. Me. Right?

I've decided to make two characters in Skyrim, one that treats the NPC's with respect and dignity, never killing them, only allowing themselves to kill each other. Ill talk, to them, get quests from them, 
roam with them. Treat them as if I was one of them.

And the other one? We'll, you can guess...

Next two blogs are gonna be about them
