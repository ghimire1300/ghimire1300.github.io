Thinking about computers, some may come to a heuristic of "Compute, memory,and
I/O". This makes sense; a computer has a processor, processing electrical information 
stored in either the ssd or hdd, or the input from a keyboard or mouse. 

There are other things to take into consideration, of course, but
the heuristic stands. 

Now, this is slightly boring, isn't it. Try teaching a kid about the
intricacies of a cpu's microarchitecture, or the difference in
structure between a Disk and Flip-Flip Gates.

But what if we analogized this heuristic into something more interesting

Greg Egan, author of Permutation City, asks a question; What is the difference
between a representation, and that which is represented?

Or, in the immortal words of my lord and savior, Charles Peirce; what is the
difference between a sign, and the interpretation of the sign?

Well, a sign has an object, while an interpretant can be treated as a sign with
its own object, but again, lets not make this technical.

Memory is the internal information that is stored in a computer. Most of the
time, it either stands for instructions, or data that is manipulated by the
instructions.

Take language itself. There are Verbs, Subjective Nouns, and Objective Nouns, 
which are affected by the Verb through the Subject. 

Now, as easy as it is for us to use these words; Verbs, Nouns, Adjectives,
Determiners, Prepositions, Pro-nouns, and god knows how much else; to 
represent reality, to help us understand everything around and about us...


Why not do the same with computer memory?
