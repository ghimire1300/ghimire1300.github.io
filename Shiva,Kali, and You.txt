Somethings happening dont speak too soon.
I had a dream that split me and you
into music
terrify, the son of doctors come, to tell you so
words mean nothing to the one who knows

She told me things that I couldnt see
told me lies that i couldnt dream
a dream of her alone
Her alone, nobody told her so
she told me so

Acting under order from a dove
Leave me be till i come running fro...
