Lately I have been bouncing erraticaly, back and forth, from one topic to another, at times, feeling jubilated at the sene of accomplishment, as if I have discovered some new law of physics, or a supernatural force beyond our own.
Then I go to sleep, or I sedate myself with television, and come back to reality, being so embarrased at my own actions, having to delete any trace of it online.

Lately, I get the sense that thigns are hopeless. I hope I'm wrong, and I need to know I'm not the only one. 

When you have something to say, but nobody to say it to, you only have one other person left.

And he is sick and tired of listening to me. So I think, its about time, I start writing this stuff out instead of talking it out.

  For better or worse, anticipate ramblings, apophenic connections, written with a false sense of security, that I may be right forever, the cost being, that I may be DEAD forever. 

  Like I said, anticipate. 

  Anticipate.
