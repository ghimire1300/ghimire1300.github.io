This is the sad tale of Old man McGee, the man trapped, both physically in 
USB, and virtually, in a cave with the undead, resfusing to kill
even that which is no longer living.

I wanted to make this character good. No killing, no hurting people. But I 
cant get past these monsters. These undead nightmares, I cant hurt
them. I dont want to. And yet...

Its just a game I say, i know that, but I don't feel it. I dont want him to 
 conjure demons. Dremora as they call it in the game's lore.

I think I take this game too seriously. i dont think I take my life
seriously enough.

But maybe, in a moment of cathartic luck, you may ask yourself...

Even if you wanted to kill these undead nightmares, could you?

Could YOU!!!
