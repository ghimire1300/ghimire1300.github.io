Domestic Violence and Drug Abuse
Intimate Relationship vs Healthy Diet

Healthy diet usually doesn't involve anything psychoactive, and Psychoactivity
doesn't necessarily determine physical health. Healthy diet refers
to eating for physical development and drug abuse often refers to things like
stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens, all affecting psychology
rather than physicality, though they may operate on physical systems. 

Domestic Violence certainly intrigues me. How the people you love, who love you
can hurt you worse than a stranger on the street, or your next door neighbor,
the guy you buy your groceries from has a better relationship with you
than your own parents? Your significant other? How?

Maybe Inimate relations cause violence. Maybe you cant be violent without being
intimate.
